## My process

I started by breeaking down the project into components, then giving each one a class or an id with HTML. Then I moved on the CSS, styling each class from the top to the bottom. There were a few times I had to go back to an element at the top to modify something, but generally, I followed the top-to-bottom process. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A new thing I learned with this challenge is how the "body" element has effects on all child elements, specifically the "height" attribute.
